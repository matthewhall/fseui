# fsui

A Firestore Emulator UI.

## Getting started

### Install

```
$ npm install fsui
```

### Usage

Ensure your Firestore emulator is running then:

```
$ fsui
```

The emulator UI will run on `9000` by default but you can adjust this by setting supplying a `--port` argument.

## Local development

```
$ npm i
$ npm run serve
```
